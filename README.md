### Identity

#### Unique Identification Number
One single Unique Identification Number (UID) to track Lebanese and anyone who enters Lebanon for any reason (work, tourist, etc.). All the existing IDs (NSSF Number, TIN#, etc.) will be linked to UID.

What suggested in [Law Number 241, dated 22/10/2012](http://www.legallaw.ul.edu.lb/Law.aspx?lawId=233448) could be impractical, government will not issue IDs for non Lebanese. One standard smart format could be a good solution.

## Energy

### Sustainable Energy
Sustainable Energy is one which is able to meet the growing demand of today's people without compromising the demand of the people that would require it in future. All renewable energy sources like solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, wave and tidal power are forms of sustainable energy.

### Smart meters 
Smart meters put consumers in control of their energy use, allowing them to adopt energy efficiency measures that can help save money on their energy bills and offset price increases. [Smart meters: a guide (gov.uk)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/smart-meters-how-they-work)

## Agriculture

### Smart Farming
Smart Farming is a farming management concept using modern technology to increase the quantity and quality of agricultural products. Farmers in the 21st century have access to GPS, soil scanning, data management, and Internet of Things technologies. By precisely measuring variations within a field and adapting the strategy accordingly, farmers can greatly increase the effectiveness of pesticides and fertilizers, and use them more selectively. Similarly, using Smart Farming techniques, farmers can better monitor the needs of individual animals and adjust their nutrition correspondingly, thereby preventing disease and enhancing herd health.
